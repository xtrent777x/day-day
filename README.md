#Day-Day Scheduler  

This is a daily scheduler application to run on the web and be 

powered by Jquery to bring the application more to life.

This is to help anyone more easily manage their time. This will give you block for your working hours 

you can click on a specific time to add an event. Once save is clicked it will remain in that block a pop up will alert oof saved event.

you can also go in edit or remove item and click save button again and it will remove item.

Added events will be saved to local storage so if page is refreshed items will still show on scheduler  and will still be able to modify items if needed.


Tru for yourself
